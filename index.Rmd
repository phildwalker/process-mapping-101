# Welcome

This book aims to document what I've been learning about process mining/ process mapping and then be a place to share with others

There are different tools available, but the one we will largely focus on exists within the R ecosystem. It is called bupaR (Business Process Analysis in R) and the documentation site for that package and the rest of the '-verse' can be found at [http://bupar.net/]

## Disclaimers
I am not a process mining

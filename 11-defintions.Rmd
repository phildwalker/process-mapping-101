# Defintions {#def}

In this section we aim to compile useful defintions to ensure that we have similar language tools

## Useful terminology

deadlock: a path deadlocks if it reaches a non-final state without any outgoing transitions
livelock: some transitions are still enabled but it is impossible to reach one of the final states
concurancy
desire line/ golden path

activity: well defined step in a process (often an event in a event log)
case: process instance
trace: the combination of activities into cases (multiple traces make up the process flow)
resource: person/device executing the activity
timestamp: crucial element of event logs

This book aims to capture what I have been learning about process mining/ process mapping. The hope is that I can make it digestable to others and use this as a way of capturing what i've worked on before

The book is going to be hosted on netlify and linked to this github repo. You can view it as it gets built out at: https://process-mapping-101.netlify.com/
